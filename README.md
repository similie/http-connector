## Introduction

**HTTP Connector** is a specialized connector within the [Model Connectors](https://github.com/yourusername/model-connectors) framework designed for front-end applications. It facilitates seamless CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations by communicating with RESTful APIs, ensuring consistent model management across different implementation environments.

Whether you're building a React, Vue, or Angular application, the HTTP Connector provides a unified interface to interact with your backend services, abstracting the complexities of HTTP requests and responses.

## Features

- **Unified CRUD Operations:** Perform create, read, update, and delete operations with a consistent API.
- **TypeScript Support:** Leverage strong typing for safer and more predictable code.
- **Configurable Endpoints:** Easily configure base URLs and endpoints to match your API structure.
- **Authentication Support:** Integrate authentication mechanisms like JWT tokens seamlessly.
- **Error Handling:** Built-in mechanisms to handle and propagate errors effectively.
- **Extensible:** Customize and extend functionalities to fit specific project needs.

## Installation

Install the `@similie/http-connector` package via npm:

```bash
npm install @similie/http-connector
```

```typescript
import { GlobalConnection, IEntity, Model } from "@similie/model-connect-entites";
import { HTTPConnector } from "@similie/http-connector";
GlobalConnection.startInstance(new HTTPConnector("https://api.example.com"));


interface IUser extends IEntity {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

class User extends Model<IUser> {
  constructor() {
    super("users");
  }
}

const uModel = new User();
const users =  uModel.find();



```
